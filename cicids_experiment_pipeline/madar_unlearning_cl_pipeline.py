MADAR+Unlearning: adds a targeted-forgetting phase after each CL task's regular
MADAR training, per the project's phasing plan (naive -> joint -> MADAR ->
MADAR+Unlearning). Built directly on madar_cl_pipeline.py -- task construction,
red agent, poisoning mechanic, classifier (ClassifierNN/TorchIDSWrapper), MADAR-IF
replay buffer, and the ER+KD+SI training step are copied verbatim, not
reimplemented, so results stay comparable to the naive/joint/MADAR runs already
collected. See madar_cl_pipeline.py's docstring for that shared rationale.

Adapted from two references: clmdu_ember18_mk6B_cd.py (a colleague's EMBER
unlearning script) and Static_Data_Pipeline/clmd_cicids_unlearning_cd.py (an
earlier, not-fully-trusted CICIDS port of it). This file is a fresh port onto
madar_cl_pipeline.py's foundation rather than a fix-up of either -- several
decisions below deliberately diverge from both, spelled out here so they're easy
to correct rather than silently baked in.

BRANCH NOTE (claude/oracle-unlearn-sample-tracking): main's version of this
file uses detect_poison_if_latent (phi1, iteration 1). This branch swaps
detection back to detect_poison_oracle (Df_t = poison_idx exactly) to
isolate a still-open question -- does the unlearning MECHANISM (steps
5/7: unlearn_teacher_guided, SI, retain+KD anchoring) behave sensibly at
all -- from detector quality, before sinking more effort into phi1/phi3-5.
If oracle-driven unlearning is well-behaved, the swings seen with phi1
(madar_u1.json/madar_u2.json: forget-set accuracy sometimes frozen,
sometimes moving the wrong direction, task 7's -0.17 collateral damage on
task 0) are downstream of what phi1 selects, not the mechanism itself --
narrowing where to look next. If oracle-driven unlearning is ALSO
unstable, the mechanism itself needs fixing before any detector iteration
matters. This branch also adds global sample-id tracking (see
update_buffer_madar/buffer_composition_summary and `gid_train` in main())
so buffer contents and poisoned samples can be traced across tasks for
later tSNE-style analysis -- independent of the oracle-vs-phi1 question,
worth porting back to main either way. UPDATE: this branch also flips
POISON_TEST_DATA on -- naive/joint/madar_cl_pipeline.py's shared
convention (and this file's own original design) was to NEVER poison test
data, since evasion rate already measures test-time generalization and
poisoning eval labels was judged likely to conflate "evaded" with "ground
truth malicious." That reasoning holds for the OTHER three pipelines
(no unlearning to test), but for THIS question it left a gap: with test
always clean, there was no way to check whether detection/unlearning
generalizes to evasive samples the classifier never trained on, only
whether it handles memorized training-time poison. POISON_TEST_DATA
applies the same evaded-mask-restricted POISON_FRACTION substitution to
each task's test split too (see its definition below for exactly what).
Unlearning stays scoped to training data only -- Df_t is never drawn from
test, since there's nothing to "forget" from data never trained on; this
only changes what per_task_eval/pooled_eval/prior_tasks_recovery measure.

UPDATE 2: per-task component order changed. Previously: train -> detect ->
unlearn -> IsolationForest/buffer -> test (test was LAST, so per_task_eval/
pooled_eval always reflected the POST-unlearning model). Now: train -> TEST
-> detect -> unlearn -> IsolationForest/buffer, so per_task_eval/pooled_eval
are the model's PRE-unlearning snapshot for task t, and that buffer refresh
is what task t+1's training reads next iteration (unchanged -- buffer was
always "this task's refresh feeds next task's training", moving test earlier
doesn't touch that). detect_poison_oracle was already maximally targeted at
this task's own perturbation samples (Df_t = poison_idx, drawn only from
Xtr/ytr, never broader) before this change and still is -- nothing to adjust
there. To avoid losing the post-unlearning view of THIS task's own numbers
(previously the headline; useful for exactly the kind of before/after
analysis done on madar_u1-u4), unlearning_metrics now separately logs
post_unlearn_this_task_eval alongside the existing prior_tasks_recovery
bracket (which still covers OLDER tasks and is untouched by this reorder).

UPDATE 3: detect_poison_oracle can now forget a partial random subsample of
poison_idx instead of always all of it -- ORACLE_FORGET_FRACTION (default
1.0 = unchanged prior behavior). Still zero false positives (Df_t is always
a subset of true poison; precision stays 1.0), but recall drops to
forget_fraction, so this simulates "the unlearner only gets told about SOME
of the poison" without touching detection logic or inventing a fake
detector. Whatever poison isn't selected stays in the retain set --
unforgotten poison is buffer-eligible exactly like phi1's false negatives
were on main. detector_eval (precision/recall) is no longer trivially
1.0/1.0 below forget_fraction=1.0 -- it now measures the subsample rate
directly, useful for sweeping "how much of the poison does the unlearner
actually need to see to keep collateral damage low."

UPDATE 5 (REWORK -- SUPERSEDES detect_poison_oracle/ORACLE_FORGET_FRACTION
and the "BUFFER ORDERING" decision below entirely; both are kept in this
docstring for history, not because they're still accurate). Forget-set
construction no longer draws directly from oracle ground truth. Instead:

  1. Oracle ground truth (poison_idx) is used ONLY to seed training labels
     for a small per-task 3-class RandomForestClassifier,
     "perturbation_classifier" (benign / malicious_clean / malicious_perturbed),
     trained on PERTURBATION_CLASSIFIER_N (default 50, shrinking uniformly
     across all three classes if any pool is short this task) samples per
     class, on raw/scaled Xtr features. See
     build_perturbation_classifier_forget_set()'s docstring for the full
     mechanics, including why raw features over the blue model's latent
     embedding (decouples this classifier from the blue model's
     still-evolving, task-to-task-shifting latent space).
  2. It then predicts on every OTHER Xtr row this task (never its own
     150-ish training rows, to avoid trivially-correct leakage in the
     logged eval metrics). potentially_perturbed_pool = predicted
     malicious_perturbed AND true (binary) label malicious -- a benign
     sample mispredicted "perturbed" is excluded, since it isn't malicious
     at all. forget_idx = potentially_perturbed_pool exactly; this is what
     unlearn_teacher_guided forgets (same mechanism as before, just a
     different-provenance forget set).
  3. BUFFER POPULATION IS NO LONGER RETAIN-ONLY. update_buffer_madar now
     always fills from the FULL task batch, unfiltered by forget/retain --
     identical call pattern to task 0 and to plain MADAR. The forget/retain
     split above is used ONLY to build unlearning's retain_loader (the
     CE+KD anchor signal), not to gate buffer eligibility anymore. This is
     a deliberate reversal of the old "poison never enters the buffer even
     transiently" design (see BUFFER ORDERING below, now stale) -- IsolationForest
     may legitimately select a potentially_perturbed_pool member into the
     buffer.
  4. CLEAN_REPLAY_BUFFER_OF_PERTURBED (toggle, default True): immediately
     after buffer fill, scan the just-refreshed buffer for entries whose
     sample_id matches potentially_perturbed_pool's global ids and remove
     them, THEN refill the malicious slot back up to budget with this task's
     own malicious samples that are NOT in potentially_perturbed_pool (the
     classifier's judgment, never oracle ground truth), ranked via the same
     IsolationForest anomaly+inlier selection as everywhere else
     (_anomaly_inlier_interleave, shared with update_buffer_madar). REWORK:
     originally no backfill (removed slots stayed empty until the next
     task's refresh happened to top them up); added because leaving the
     slot chronically under-filled confounds "effect of forgetting perturbed
     samples" with "effect of a smaller buffer" -- plain MADAR's buffer
     never shrinks this way, so the size gap alone could bias any comparison
     between the two pipelines. If fewer clean-malicious candidates exist
     than the deficit, the slot stays under-filled by whatever's left over.
     When the toggle is off, the buffer is left exactly as IsolationForest
     selected it (may contain potentially_perturbed_pool members).
  5. Both the 3-class confusion matrix (against full oracle ground truth on
     the eval rows) and the 2-class collapsed accuracy/balanced_accuracy
     are logged per task under unlearning.perturbation_classifier, so
     precision/recall of the classifier itself -- e.g. how many true
     malicious_perturbed rows it actually caught, how many
     malicious_clean rows it mislabeled as perturbed -- is directly visible
     without cross-referencing anything else.

UPDATE (REWORK, benign perturbation classifier): perturbation_classifier is
now 4-class (benign / malicious_clean / malicious_perturbed /
benign_perturbed), mirroring points 1-5 above exactly on the benign side --
poison_idx_benign (from the new red_train_benign_pert_agent, see module
docstring) seeds benign_perturbed's training labels the same way poison_idx
seeds malicious_perturbed's; potentially_perturbed_benign_pool = predicted
benign_perturbed AND true (binary) label benign, same construction as
potentially_perturbed_pool. forget_idx fed to unlearn_teacher_guided is now
the UNION of both pools (one unlearning pass covers both populations --
unlearn_teacher_guided doesn't care why a sample is in the forget set).
CLEAN_REPLAY_BUFFER_OF_PERTURBED's clean+refill (point 4 above) is likewise
mirrored per label slot: the malicious slot is cleaned/refilled using only
forget_idx_malicious as before, and the benign slot is now ALSO
cleaned of forget_idx_benign matches and refilled from this task's own
clean-benign candidates, via the same shared _anomaly_inlier_interleave
selection. See build_perturbation_classifier_forget_set()'s docstring for
the full mechanics.

Outline this implements (task loop, for each task t with a red agent):
  1. Train on Tt via MADAR's existing ER+KD+SI step (train_cl_er, unchanged).
  2/6. Update replay buffer P -- see "buffer ordering" below for the one change
       from the outline's literal order.
  3. Detect poison in Tt -> Df_t -- see "poison detection" below.
  4. If Df_t is empty, skip unlearning for this task.
  5. Unlearn Df_t (unlearn_teacher_guided) -- SI-protected, KD-anchored on the
     retain set + replay buffer, forget loss pushes Df_t toward uniform.
  7. Verify recovery -- see "verify recovery" below for what's logged.
  8. Move to task t+1.

Four decisions made, not silently assumed (flag anything you want changed):

  - POISON DETECTION (step 3): on main, being built iteratively (iteration 1
    shipped phi1 -- an IsolationForest decision_function score over the
    latent embedding of this task's malicious-labeled samples, forgetting the
    MIDDLE band; ported from split_option_b_donut_hole in the EMBER unlearning
    reference, clmdu_ember18_mk6B_cd.py, with its per-malware-family joint-fit
    machinery dropped since CICIDS poisoning only ever touches the
    malicious-labeled population). Planned iteration 2 there: phi3 (per-sample
    CE loss), phi4 (normalized entropy), phi5 (top-two margin) -- model-
    behavior features expected to matter more than phi1/phi2's raw geometry
    against evasion-crafted poisoning specifically, computed against the
    PRE-task-t teacher_model snapshot rather than the post-CL-training model
    (by the time detection runs post-training, the model has already fit Tt's
    labels, poison included, so post-training confidence features are
    measuring "did training just memorize this," not "does this look
    evasive"). phi6/phi7 (malware-family based) don't transfer to CICIDS.

    THIS BRANCH originally overrode all of that with detect_poison_oracle()
    (Df_t = poison_idx directly, no detection logic at all -- see the BRANCH
    NOTE above for why). STALE as of UPDATE 5 above: forget-set construction
    is now build_perturbation_classifier_forget_set(), which uses poison_idx
    only to seed a small classifier's training labels, not to build Df_t
    directly.

  - WEIGHT PROTECTION during unlearning uses the existing SI (omega/p_old_task)
    machinery already implemented and validated in madar_cl_pipeline.py, not
    MAS (Memory Aware Synapses) as literally named in the outline. Both
    reference scripts also use SI here, not MAS, despite the outline's
    wording -- MAS is a different importance computation (gradient of squared
    output-norm, not SI's path integral) that neither reference implements and
    that would need to be built and validated from scratch for no
    demonstrated benefit yet. The first smoke test (madar_u1.json) showed
    forget-set accuracy completely unmoved on several tasks (2/3/4: exactly
    1.000 -> 1.000 despite real gradient steps) alongside catastrophic
    prior-task collateral damage on another (task 7: -0.17 balanced accuracy
    on task 0, isolated to the unlearning phase specifically by
    prior_tasks_recovery) -- inconsistent, task-dependent symptoms consistent
    with SI's diagonal per-parameter penalty sometimes freezing the forget
    objective and sometimes failing to protect against it, rather than a
    single miscalibration to fix with one number. Rather than swap frameworks
    on a hypothesis, unlearn_teacher_guided now returns raw (pre-weighting)
    loss-component magnitudes and omega's L2 norm every call (see its
    docstring) so this can be checked directly, and UNLEARN_SI_C decouples
    unlearning's SI weight from CL training's SI_C (still 1.0, unchanged) --
    set to 0.1 as a first-pass guess, meant to be tuned against the next
    smoke test's diagnostics rather than treated as settled.

  - BUFFER ORDERING deviates from the outline's literal steps 2/6 (add Tt to
    the buffer in full, forget-detect, then filter Df_t back out afterward).
    Both reference scripts instead compute the forget/retain split FIRST,
    unlearn, and update the buffer ONCE from the retain set only -- poison
    never enters the buffer even transiently, and it's one buffer touch per
    task instead of two. Adopted as-is here. STALE as of UPDATE 5 above: the
    buffer now fills from the FULL task batch (unfiltered), closer to the
    outline's literal steps 2/6 after all, with CLEAN_REPLAY_BUFFER_OF_PERTURBED
    doing the "filter back out" part post-hoc instead of pre-filtering.

  - VERIFY RECOVERY (step 7) was under-logged in both references: they report
    forget/retain-set accuracy before/after (measure_unlearning_efficacy,
    kept as-is below), which is all THIS task's own data -- not "accuracy on
    held-out clean data from prior tasks" as the outline asks for. Added here:
    prior_tasks_recovery in each checkpoint's "unlearning" block snapshots
    every earlier task's held-out test accuracy immediately before and after
    the unlearning phase specifically (not just before/after the whole task,
    which the regular per_task_eval already gives you) -- isolating what
    unlearning itself did to old-task retention from what CL training did.

Everything else (SI bookkeeping order, KD-against-model_pre_unlearn instead of
the CL replay teacher, the alpha=0 control-ablation semantics, forget loss
targeting the full 2-class distribution since CICIDS never has a
prev_active_count:active_count "newly introduced class range" to target
specifically) is carried over from the two references unchanged; see the
docstrings on unlearn_teacher_guided / measure_unlearning_efficacy below for
exactly what and why.

UPDATE (REWORK, dual red agents): each task now trains TWO red agents
instead of one -- red_train_pert_agent (env built directly from X_train,
only ever perturbs train data) and red_test_pert_agent (env built directly
from X_test, only ever perturbs test data, trained second). This fixes a
latent bug in the old single-agent design: NetworkAttackEnv.reset() always
samples from self.X_data, fixed at construction; the old code built ONE env
from X_train and reused it unmodified for the "test" evaluate_agent_on_batch
call (update_data() existed on the class but was never called), so what was
logged as test_evasion_rate/X_test_pert was actually attacking train rows at
test-derived indices, never real test data. agent_id is now a compound
"{task_id}_{agent_type}" string registered in the SAME contrastive bank, so
each agent's reward is pushed away from every previously-registered agent
(train and test, all earlier tasks) via the existing recency-weighted
mechanism -- train_t vs train_{t-1}, test_t vs test_{t-1}, and (since test
trains second, same task) test_t vs train_t, though that last one is
necessarily one-directional: train_t finishes training before test_t exists,
so train_t's reward never references test_t. Evasion success stays a hard
requirement independent of this diversity pressure: the +10 reward bonus for
successful misclassification dominates the reward magnitude, and
REQUIRE_EVASION_SUCCESS (unchanged) still means only genuinely-evasive
perturbations (evaded_mask=True) ever become poison candidates for either
pool. red_test_pert_agent only trains when POISON_TEST_DATA is on AND this
task actually has malicious test samples, to avoid training a whole second
SAC agent for nothing. Also: POISON_SCHEDULE_ENABLED flipped to False (flat
POISON_FRACTION_FLAT=0.30 for both train and test, every task) -- moving
away from the per-task schedule per explicit request; the schedule code
itself is untouched and can be re-enabled by flipping the toggle back.

    Trains a small per-task RandomForestClassifier ("perturbation_classifier")
    to distinguish benign / malicious_clean / malicious_perturbed /
    benign_perturbed on RAW (already-scaled) Xtr features, then uses its
    predictions -- not oracle ground truth -- to build the forget set.
    benign_perturbed mirrors malicious_perturbed exactly (same construction,
    same eval, same downstream forget-pool logic), just on the benign side:
    poison_idx_benign is to benign_idx what poison_idx is to mal_idx.

    1. Oracle draws N per class (benign_clean = benign minus
       poison_idx_benign, malicious_clean = malicious minus poison_idx,
       malicious_perturbed = poison_idx, benign_perturbed =
       poison_idx_benign), N shrinking uniformly across all FOUR classes if
       any pool has fewer than n_target available this task, so the
       training set stays class-balanced. This is the ONLY place
       poison_idx/poison_idx_benign's ground truth "perturbed" label is
       ever handed to a model as a training target -- nothing downstream of
       this classifier sees it.
    2. Classifier trains on those 4*N samples only, then predicts on every
       OTHER Xtr sample this task (never its own training rows -- avoids
       leaking their trivially-known labels into the eval metrics below).
    3. potentially_perturbed_pool = predicted malicious_perturbed AND whose
       actual ytr label is mal_label (the ordinary binary label the rest of
       the pipeline sees -- a benign sample the classifier mislabels
       "perturbed" is excluded, since it isn't malicious at all).
       potentially_perturbed_benign_pool = the mirror: predicted
       benign_perturbed AND whose actual ytr label is benign_label.

    forget_idx = potentially_perturbed_pool UNION potentially_perturbed_benign_pool
    -- fed to a single unlearn_teacher_guided call (that function doesn't
    care WHY something's in the forget set, just pushes it toward uniform).
    forget_idx_malicious/forget_idx_benign are also returned individually so
    the buffer-clean/refill step (main()) can clean each label's buffer
    slot using only the matches relevant to that slot. retain_idx =
    everything else -- used ONLY to build unlearning's retain_loader (the
    CE+KD anchor signal), NOT for buffer eligibility (see module docstring/
    UPDATE 5 -- buffer now fills from the full task batch, unfiltered, and
    gets cleaned of forget-pool matches afterward instead).

    Returns None if n_target shrinks to 0 for any class this task (no
    poison on either side, or one of the four pools is empty) -- caller
    should skip the classifier/forget-set step entirely for this task, same
    as the old empty-Df_t path. Otherwise returns a dict: forget_idx,
    forget_idx_malicious, forget_idx_benign, retain_idx (sorted int64
    arrays into Xtr), n_used (the actual per-class N after shrinking),
    confusion_matrix (4x4, row/col order == PERTURBATION_CLASSIFIER_CLASSES,

    true benign; predicted malicious_clean OR malicious_perturbed ->
    compare to true malicious; accuracy + balanced_accuracy over the SAME
    held-out eval rows), and n_eval (how many rows the classifier was
