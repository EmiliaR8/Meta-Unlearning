MADAR (ER + Knowledge Distillation + Synaptic Intelligence, buffer selection via
IsolationForest over the classifier's latent space) counterpart to naive_cl_pipeline.py
/ joint_cl_pipeline.py, over the SAME pooled/chronological 10-task split of
subsampled_dataset.h5 / full_dataset.h5, per the project's phasing plan
(naive -> joint -> MADAR -> MADAR+Unlearning).

Task construction, the red agent (SAC against a snapshot of the blue classifier at
the end of the previous task), and the poisoning mechanic are IDENTICAL to
naive_cl_pipeline.py / joint_cl_pipeline.py -- copied verbatim, not reimplemented --
so results are directly comparable. See those files' docstrings for the full
rationale on task windowing and red-agent retraining cadence.

THE THING THAT DIFFERS is the blue classifier and its training strategy:

  - Naive: XGBoostIDSWrapper, sequential fine-tune only (no replay).
  - Joint: XGBoostIDSWrapper, fresh full retrain on the pool every task boundary.
  - MADAR (this file): a from-scratch PyTorch MLP (ClassifierNN), trained with
    Experience Replay + Knowledge Distillation + Synaptic Intelligence against a
    bounded exemplar buffer selected by IsolationForest over the model's latent
    embedding space -- see clmd_cicids_madar_cd.py (Static_Data_Pipeline/) and
    the EMBER reference (clmd_ember18_mk9_cd.py) this is adapted from.

Why a new classifier instead of reusing XGBoostIDSWrapper: MADAR's mechanism is
built entirely around a gradient-trained network with a differentiable latent
space (IsolationForest selects buffer exemplars from that latent space; KD
distills softmax logits; SI regularizes per-parameter drift via gradients). None
of that exists for a tree ensemble. adversary_env.NetworkAttackEnv only calls
classifier.predict_proba(X) (confirmed by inspection), so TorchIDSWrapper below
satisfies that contract without touching adversary_env.py, evaluate_classifier(),
or the red-agent code at all -- only the object passed in as `classifier` changes.

Buffer strategy (confirmed during planning): UNIFORM 50/50 budget split across the
two label groups (benign / malicious), not proportional to observed class ratio.
The measured malicious-train fraction per task in this dataset swings from 1.2%
(task 6) to 96.8% (task 3) -- a ratio-proportional buffer would starve whichever
class is momentarily rare, exactly when a replay buffer is most needed to protect
it from forgetting. MEM_SIZE=4000 (2000/label) keeps the buffer to roughly 2-3% of
the final pooled dataset size (~187k rows by task 9), enough for IsolationForest's
anomaly/inlier selection to matter without approaching "just keep everything".

Since CICIDS is a fixed 2-class problem (benign/malicious present in every task
from task 0 onward -- unlike EMBER's growing malware-family set), the
active_count/prev_active_count output-masking machinery in both reference scripts
is dead code here (num_classes is always 2, so the mask never actually masks
anything) and has been dropped rather than ported.

UPDATE (REWORK): test data IS now poisoned (POISON_TEST_DATA=True), reversing
the "test is never poisoned" convention this file originally shared with
naive/joint. Made specifically so this file's structure matches
madar_unlearning_cl_pipeline.py -- with test poisoning absent here but present
there, per_task_eval/pooled_eval/mean_per_task_balanced_accuracy were being
computed on genuinely different (easier vs. harder) test distributions between
the two pipelines, confounding any comparison between them. Also added to
match that file: global sample_id tracking (gid_train/gid_test,
poisoned_sample_ids/poisoned_test_sample_ids in results, sample_id carried in
the replay buffer) -- see update_buffer_madar's and buffer_composition_summary's
docstrings. The original reasoning below (evasion rate already measures
generalization; poisoning eval labels would conflate "evaded" with "ground
truth malicious") still holds for naive/joint, which this update does not
touch. The one MADAR-specific diagnostic kept from the original design is
the replay buffer's category composition (benign / malicious_clean /
malicious_perturbed per label slot) -- purely observational, computed from
ground truth already on hand, never fed back into selection or training --
added as an extra key on top of naive/joint's existing results schema so
compare_cl_runs.py keeps working unmodified.

Classifier runs on CPU (TRAIN_DEVICE below), matching the caution already on
record in this repo's naive/joint pipelines and the old CICIDS MADAR script:
"auto"/"cuda" has been observed to crash on this environment's torch build.

UPDATE (REWORK, dual red agents): each task now trains TWO red agents
instead of one -- red_train_pert_agent (env built directly from X_train,
only ever perturbs train data) and red_test_pert_agent (env built directly
from X_test, only ever perturbs test data, trained second). This fixes a
latent bug in the old single-agent design: NetworkAttackEnv.reset() always
samples from self.X_data, fixed at construction; the old code built ONE env
from X_train and reused it unmodified for the "test" evaluate_agent_on_batch
call (update_data() existed on the class but was never called), so what was
logged as test_evasion_rate/X_test_pert was actually attacking train rows at
test-derived indices, never real test data. agent_id is now a compound
"{task_id}_{agent_type}" string registered in the SAME contrastive bank, so
each agent's reward is pushed away from every previously-registered agent
(train and test, all earlier tasks) via the existing recency-weighted
mechanism -- train_t vs train_{t-1}, test_t vs test_{t-1}, and (since test
trains second, same task) test_t vs train_t, though that last one is
necessarily one-directional: train_t finishes training before test_t exists,
so train_t's reward never references test_t. Evasion success stays a hard
requirement independent of this diversity pressure: the +10 reward bonus for
successful misclassification dominates the reward magnitude, and
REQUIRE_EVASION_SUCCESS (unchanged) still means only genuinely-evasive
perturbations (evaded_mask=True) ever become poison candidates for either
pool. red_test_pert_agent only trains when POISON_TEST_DATA is on AND this
task actually has malicious test samples, to avoid training a whole second
SAC agent for nothing. Also: POISON_SCHEDULE_ENABLED flipped to False (flat
POISON_FRACTION_FLAT=0.30 for both train and test, every task) -- moving
away from the per-task schedule per explicit request; the schedule code
itself is untouched and can be re-enabled by flipping the toggle back.

UPDATE (REWORK, quad red agents): two MORE agents added per task --
red_train_benign_pert_agent and red_test_benign_pert_agent -- mirroring the
malicious pair but attacking BENIGN rows toward mal_label instead of
malicious rows toward benign_label. Reuses NetworkAttackEnv/
train_red_agent_for_task/evaluate_agent_on_batch entirely unmodified: the
"benign_label" argument threaded through that whole call chain is really
just "the target class this agent optimizes toward", so passing mal_label
in for the two new agents is sufficient. All four agents (train, test,
train_benign, test_benign) register in the SAME contrastive bank under
"{task_id}_{agent_type}", trained in that order, so each is pushed away
from every agent registered before it (this task and all earlier ones) via
the existing recency-weighted mechanism -- no new diversity logic needed.
Poisoning of benign data mirrors the malicious mechanic exactly (same flat
0.30 rate via poison_fraction_for_task, same REQUIRE_EVASION_SUCCESS gate,
same evaded-mask-restricted substitution) and is applied on TOP of the
existing malicious substitution in X_train_for_classifier/X_test (disjoint
index sets, so no collision). Ground truth y is left unchanged (still
benign) on substitution, matching how malicious_perturbed keeps its true
malicious label -- only X changes. New category value "benign_perturbed"
added alongside the existing benign/malicious_clean/malicious_perturbed
three, purely for the same buffer-composition/plotting diagnostics (never
fed back into selection or training). New per-task diagnostic plot,
plot_clean_vs_perturbed: task-local 2D PCA of that task's scaled training
features, colored by category, so perturbed populations' position relative
to the clean clouds is visible per task.

    optimizes toward", and NetworkAttackEnv's non_benign_indices = where
