"""
NN-1: a tiny per-sample scorer for learned forget-set selection.

Deliberately small so Evolution Strategies can train it from scalar rewards.
Default is LINEAR (7 feature weights + bias = 8 parameters): well within
small-population ES reach, and directly interpretable - each learned weight
answers "does this property make a sample worth unlearning?". A one-hidden-
layer MLP is available via hidden>0 once the linear version shows signal
(expect to need a substantially larger evaluation budget for it).

Features per current-task sample (computed in the inner loop, z-scored
within the task so scales are comparable across tasks/datasets):
    0. Isolation-Forest score in LATENT space (joint over the task)
    1. Isolation-Forest score in RAW feature space (joint over the task)
    2. Per-sample cross-entropy loss under the current model
    3. Prediction entropy (normalized by log #active classes)
    4. Margin (top-1 prob minus top-2 prob)
    5. Latent L2 distance to own family centroid
    6. log10(family size)

Selection: score every sample, forget the TOP `ratio` fraction by score.
(The sign convention is learned; ES is free to invert any feature.)
